Data from the Urban Institute "Household Conditions by Geographic School District" and "State-by-State Spending on Kids Dataset" were used together to explore potential non-school factors that could be impacting student grades on a state level, measured by estimated average GPA.

This project was originally from my last semester as an undergraduate statistics major (May 2022) and was meant to be complete report using only Jupyter Notebook.
      
It has since been updated (September 2023) to include Beta and GLM models using transformations of estimated GPA, as well as new visualizations using Plotly Express and general revisions for code consistency.
